# Portal Initial Slice

## Purpose

Define the first actually playable subset before broader `Portal` support.

## Card Universe

The initial playable universe contains only these legal card identities:

- `Border Guard` from `Portal`
- `Foot Soldiers` from `Portal`
- `Plains` from `Portal`

This slice uses vanilla `Portal` creatures plus a basic land to minimize the first rules envelope.
Multiplicity is allowed as normal so long as no card identity outside this universe is introduced.

## Play Mode

- Two-player only
- Normal gameplay structure only
- No multiplayer support
- No format-legality enforcement beyond the explicitly chosen card universe

## Card Text Authority

- Use Scryfall oracle text only for gameplay behavior.
- Ignore flavor text for implementation decisions.

## Initial Constraints

- No keyword support is required in the first slice.
- The first slice should implement only the rule families actually needed by this universe.
- Any new card added beyond this universe should trigger a rules-gap review before implementation.

## Current Implementation Note

- The currently implemented slice supports deterministic setup, first-turn progression, land play, and white-mana generation.
- Additional setup scenarios may use multiple copies of `Plains`, `Border Guard`, and `Foot Soldiers` without widening the universe.
